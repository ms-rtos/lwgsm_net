Configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Library comes with template config file, which can be modified according to needs.
This file shall be named ``lwgsm_opts.h`` and its default template looks like the one below.

.. note::
    Default configuration template file location: ``lwgsm/src/include/lwgsm/lwgsm_opts_template.h``.
    File must be renamed to ``lwgsm_opts.h`` first and then copied to the project directory (or simply renamed in-place) where compiler
    include paths have access to it by using ``#include "lwgsm_opts.h"``.
